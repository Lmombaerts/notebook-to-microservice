This repository contains the companion code to accompany my article [From Jupyter Notebook to Production - A Straightforward Example](link). The article begins with a typical toy problem with a simple data pipeline solution in Jupyter Notebook format and develops it into a deployed microservice with this repository storing the code following each of the four steps in the article.
